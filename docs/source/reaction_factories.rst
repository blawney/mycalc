Reaction Factories (reaction_factories.py)
============================================

This module has code related to the creation of protein-ligand reactions.  Description
of the eventual models may be created from text files or via another method (e.g. GUI) and
the reaction factory classes provide a means to interpret those sources and create reaction
objects.
